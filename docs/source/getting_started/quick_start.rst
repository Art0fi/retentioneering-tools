Quick start with Retentioneering
================================

Retentioneering makes product analytics very easy once you have the raw data.

Every user action and every visited page or screen from your website or app,
all these interactions we call events. To understand deeply how different types
of user behavior in your product affects your business metrics, you need to
analyze the sequences of events for each user which are called user paths or trajectories.

1. Load data
------------

Retentioneering stores data in its core class ``Eventstream``
(see :doc:`eventstream concept<../user_guides/eventstream>` explanation for details)
which allow to treat a clickstream in an efficient way.

To create an eventstream you can pick from any of two options:

**Option 1. To start with our dummy online shop dataset sample.**


.. code-block:: python

    from retentioneering import datasets

    # load sample user behavior data:
    stream = datasets.load_simple_shop()

In the shell of eventstream object there is a regular pandas dataframe:

.. code-block:: python

    stream.to_dataframe().head()

.. raw:: html

    <div>
    <table class="dataframe">
      <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
          <th></th>
          <th>user_id</th>
          <th>event</th>
          <th>timestamp</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>0</th>
          <td>219483890</td>
          <td>catalog</td>
          <td>2019-11-01 17:59:13.273932</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>1</th>
          <td>219483890</td>
          <td>product1</td>
          <td>2019-11-01 17:59:28.459271</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>2</th>
          <td>219483890</td>
          <td>cart</td>
          <td>2019-11-01 17:59:29.502214</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>3</th>
          <td>219483890</td>
          <td>catalog</td>
          <td>2019-11-01 17:59:32.557029</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>4</th>
          <td>964964743</td>
          <td>catalog</td>
          <td>2019-11-01 21:38:19.283663</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>

|

As you can see in this fragment of example dataset, user with id ``219483890`` has 4 events
on the website with specific timestamps on ``2019-11-01``. This is all you need to try out
what Retentioneering is about. You are ready to go with this dataset and proceed to step 2.

**Option 2. Alternatively, you can start with your own dataset.**

If you have your raw data of user behavior for example in csv format simply upload it as pandas dataframe:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from retentioneering.eventstream import Eventstream

    # load your own csv
    data = pd.read_csv("your_own_data_file.csv")
    stream = Eventstream(data)

We assume that the data contains at least three columns: ``user_id``, ``event``, ``timestamp``.
If your columns have another names, you need either to rename them in the pandas dataframe or explicitly
set data schema. See :doc:`eventstream guide<../user_guides/eventstream>` for details.

How to get a csv file with data? Raw data in the form of ``{user, event, timestamp}`` can be
streamed via Google Analytics 360 or free Google Analytics App+Web into BigQuery.
From the BigQuery console you can run SQL query and export data into csv file,
alternatively you can use the Python BigQuery connector to get directly into the dataframe.
If you have big datasets, we suggest you take fraction of users in SQL query,
filtering by the user id (just add this condition to SQL WHERE statement to get 10% of your users:
``and ABS(MOD(FARM_FINGERPRINT(fullVisitorId), 10)) = 0)``.


2. Prepare the data
-------------------

Raw data is often needed to be prepared before applying analytical techniques.
Retentioneering provides a wide range of preprocessing tools which should
become a Swiss knife for a product analytics. We call them *data processors*.
With a help of data processors a product analyst easily add, delete or group
events, truncate a clickstream in a flexible manner,
split the trajectories into sessions, and many more.

Suppose you want to analyze only user first sessions instead of the whole clickstream.
Here's how you can easily achieve this using the developed data processors:

.. code-block:: python

    # eventstream preprocessing
    stream \
        .split_sessions(session_cutoff=(30, "m")) \
        .filter(func=lambda df_, schema: df_["session_id"].str.endswith("_1")) \
        .to_dataframe()

``split_sessions`` method creates a new column ``session_id``
with the values ending with suffix ``_<int>`` indicating the ordinary number
of each user's session. Thus, we need to leave only those records where ``session_id``
ends with ``_1``. This is exactly what the next method ``filter`` does.

You can learn more about dataprocessors :doc:`in this guide<../user_guides/dataprocessors>`.
Finally, we convert the output eventstream to a pandas dataframe.

Also, for more complex preprocessing scenarios Retentioneering offers a
great graphical tool which allows you to represent sheets of preprocessing code as a
neat calculation graph.
See :red:`TODO - set the link to preprocessing user guide` for the details.


3. Explore the data
-------------------

Retentioneering has many powerful tools for exploring users behavior, including funnels,
transition graphs, step matrices, step sankey diagrams, cluster and cohort analysis.
Below we show just a short demo. For more details please study
:doc:`our guides<../user_guide>`.

Transition graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`TransitionGraph user guide<../user_guides/transition_graph>` to understand that tool deeper.


.. code-block:: python

    stream.transition_graph(
        thresholds={
            'nodes': {'events': 0.06},
            'edges': {'events': 0.06}
        },
        norm_type=None,
        targets={
            "lost": "bad",
            "payment_done": "nice",
            "main": "source"
        }
    );

.. raw:: html

    <iframe
        width="700"
        height="600"
        src="../_static/getting_started/quick_start/transition_graph.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>


The ``Transition graph`` represents CJM as Markov random walk model and shows how often
the users jumps from one event to another. The graph is interactive and you can move
the graph nodes by clicking them, zoom-in/zoom-out the graph layout, etc.
Also, you can highlight the most valuable nodes and hide noisy nodes and edges.

Step matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`StepMatrix user guide<../user_guides/step_matrix>` to understand that tool deeper.

Step matrix provides a step-wise look at CJM.
It shows the event distribution with respect to a step ordinal number.

.. code-block:: python

    stream.step_matrix(
        max_steps=16,
        thresh=0.2,
        centered={
            "event": "cart",
            "left_gap": 5,
            "occurrence": 1
        },
        targets=['payment_done']
    );

.. figure:: /_static/getting_started/quick_start/step_matrix.png
    :width: 900

Step Sankey diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`StepSankey user guide<../user_guides/step_sankey>` to understand that tool deeper.

Step Sankey diagram is similar to step matrix, but it has some advances:

- it explicitly shows the user flow,
- it is interactive.

.. code-block:: python

    stream.step_sankey(max_steps=6, thresh=0.05)

.. raw:: html

    <div style="overflow:auto;">
    <iframe
        width="1200"
        height="500"
        src="../_static/getting_started/quick_start/step_sankey.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>

Cluster analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`Clusters user guide<../user_guides/clusters>` to understand that tool deeper.

.. code-block:: python

    from retentioneering.tooling.clusters import Clusters

    clusters = Clusters(stream)
    clusters.fit(method="kmeans", n_clusters=8, feature_type="tfidf", ngram_range=(1, 2))
    clusters.plot(targets=["payment_done", "cart"])

.. figure:: /_static/getting_started/quick_start/clusters.png
    :width: 900

Users with similar behavior grouped in the same cluster. Clusters
with low conversion rate can represent systematic problem in the product:
specific behavior pattern which does not lead to product goals.
Obtained user segments can be explored deeper to understand problematic behavior pattern.
In the example above for instance, cluster 4 has low conversion
rate to purchase but high conversion rate to cart visit.


Funnel analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`Funnel user guide<../user_guides/funnel>` to understand that tool deeper.

.. code-block:: python

    stream.funnel(stages = ['catalog', 'cart', 'payment_done']);


.. raw:: html

    <iframe
        width="700"
        height="400"
        src="../_static/getting_started/quick_start/funnel.html"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>

Building a conversion funnel is the basic first step in almost all
product analytics workflows.

For each specified stage event, the following will be calculated:

- absolute unique number of user_idâ€™s who reach this stage at least once.
- conversion from the first stage (`% of initial`)
- conversion from the previous stage (`% of previous`)


Cohorts analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`Cohorts user guide<../user_guides/cohorts>` to understand that tool deeper.

.. code-block:: python

    stream.cohorts(
        cohort_start_unit='M',
        cohort_period=(1,'M'),
        average=False,
        cut_bottom=0,
        cut_right=0,
        cut_diagonal=0
    );

.. figure:: /_static/getting_started/quick_start/cohorts.png
    :width: 500
    :height: 500


Cohorts it's a powerfull tool that shows differences and trends in users behavior over time.

It helps to isolate the impact of different marketing activities or changes in a product for
different groups of users.

Basic algorithm of ``Cohort Matrix`` calculation:

- Users divided into ``Cohorts`` or ``CohortGroups`` depending on the time of their first appearance in the eventstream
- Then the retention rate of active users calculated in each further period (``CohortPeriod``) of observation.
